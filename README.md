# SimpleRobot
A simple robot project I made out of boredom in about an hour during my AP Computer Science Final

SimpleRobot is the original program, and SimpleRobotNoStop was an attempt at removing the pause in movement. SimpleRobotNoStop currently does not do what it is intended to, as I ran out of time and then wasn't able to test it.  

You can see my instructables write up for this project at [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Arduino-Rover/)

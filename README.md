# SimpleRobot
A simple robot project I made out of boredom in about an hour during my AP Computer Science Final

SimpleRobot is my original code, and Simple robot no stop was an attempt at removing the pause due to the wait function in the original program. 

You can see my instructables write up for this project at http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Arduino-Rover/
